# Notes from Week 1 of Time Value of Money from Introduction to Finance Specialisation of University of Michigan on Coursera

A. Time Value Of Money (TVM)
============================

1. Finance is the study of value.

2. Value has two important key components, time and uncertainty.

3. Every decision involves time and uncertainty.

4. Importsnt to understand the impact of just passage of time on a decision.

5. QUE: What does the instructor means by "We will first assume no uncertainty to internalise the time value of money"?

6. Terminology:

	PV = Present Value ($)

	FV = Future Value ($)

	n = # of Periods (#)

	r = Interest Rate (%) > 0 (assumption)

7. Theory of Interest - Irving Fisher (1930) - READ

B. Simple Future Value (FV)
============================

8. TIME LINES

9. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.

10. MONEY CANNOT BE COMPARED ACROSS TIME. IT WOULD HAPPEN ONLY WHEN MONEY DID NOT HAVE VALUE.

11. Every value creating decision that we make, should force us to look into the future.

12. In general, Future Value = Initial Payment + Accumulated Interest.
	
	FV = PV + r*P = (1 + r)PV

	(1 + r) is called "Future Value Factor". It tells the future value of one dollar.

13. Is it compunding?

14. For n periods:

	FV = PV * (1 + r) ^ n

C. Simple Present Value
==========================

15. PV = FV / (1 + r) ^ n (For period of "n")

16. DISCOUNTING: Because larger in the future, becomes smaller today (If r > 0) .
