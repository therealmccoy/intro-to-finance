This repository contains the notes of lectures and assignments that I study and solve, while studying the course of "Introduction To Finance" from University of Michigan on Coursera.

This course is taught by Prof Gautam Kaul, PhD.

This is a specialisation course consisting of 4 parts and topped by a capstone project.

So far, I have not enrolled in this specialisation, intending to take a certificate (a decision which may change over the course of time) and hence would just audit all the courses, try to be in top 1 percentile of all the students.
